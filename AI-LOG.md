# AI-LOG.md — Cosmic Watch Backend

	⁠This document details how AI tools were used during development, as required by the hackathon rules. *All credits go to the author (Satyabrata Behera, Satyabrata Behera, Abhisake Sahoo).* AI was used *only* for coding assistance — the real logic, design ideas, architecture decisions, and all creative assets were conceptualized and directed by the authors.

## Author

*Satya* — Full project ownership, architecture design, and creative direction.

## What the Author Created (100% Original Work)

The following were entirely created by the author with *no AI involvement*:

### Design & Creative Vision
•⁠  ⁠*Project concept*: Real-time asteroid monitoring and risk analysis platform
•⁠  ⁠*UI/UX design*: All frontend design decisions and visual aesthetics
•⁠  ⁠*Architecture design*: Microservice split (Node.js + Python), database schema, API design patterns
•⁠  ⁠*Feature set*: All feature requirements and user experience decisions
•⁠  ⁠*Risk scoring system*: The 6-factor scoring algorithm concept and physics-based approach

### Assets & Resources
•⁠  ⁠*All visual assets*: Collected, curated, or created by the author
•⁠  ⁠*API integration strategy*: Selection and integration approach for 6 NASA APIs
•⁠  ⁠*Database schema design*: Entity relationships, role-based access control structure
•⁠  ⁠*Documentation structure*: All documentation content and organization

### Technical Decisions
•⁠  ⁠*Tech stack selection*: Express 5, Prisma 7, PostgreSQL, FastAPI, Socket.io, astropy
•⁠  ⁠*Security architecture*: JWT authentication, RBAC, rate limiting strategies
•⁠  ⁠*Deployment architecture*: Docker multi-stage builds, service orchestration

## How AI Was Used (Coding Assistance Only)

AI (Antigravity with Gimini 3 Pro) was used *strictly as a coding assistant* — similar to using code completion or referencing documentation. The author directed all development.

### 1. Boilerplate Generation
•⁠  ⁠Generated initial folder structure and TypeScript configuration
•⁠  ⁠Created repetitive CRUD patterns (controller → service → route)
•⁠  ⁠Set up Docker multi-stage build templates

### 2. Code Translation
•⁠  ⁠Translated author's pseudocode and verbal descriptions into TypeScript/Python
•⁠  ⁠Generated Zod validation schemas from payload descriptions
•⁠  ⁠Converted scientific formulas into NumPy/astropy code

### 3. Syntax Assistance
•⁠  ⁠Express v5 migration patterns and type handling
•⁠  ⁠Prisma 7 driver adapter configuration
•⁠  ⁠FastAPI route boilerplate and Pydantic models

### 4. Debugging Support
•⁠  ⁠Assisted with identifying typos and syntax errors
•⁠  ⁠Suggested fixes for type incompatibilities
•⁠  ⁠Helped trace configuration issues

## What AI Did NOT Do

| Category | Author Responsibility |
|----------|----------------------|
| *System Architecture* | All microservice design, tech stack choices, and data flow designed by author |
| *Business Logic* | All feature requirements, scoring algorithms, and risk analysis logic defined by author |
| *Creative Assets* | All images, designs, and visual elements sourced/created by author |
| *Database Design* | Entity relationships, schema structure, and indexing strategies designed by author |
| *API Design* | Endpoint naming, request/response structures, and error handling defined by author |
| *Documentation Content* | All explanations, examples, and technical writing authored by developer |
| *Testing Strategy* | Test case design and validation approach determined by author |

## Summary

| Aspect | Ownership |
|--------|-----------|
| *Concept & Vision* | 100% Author |
| *Architecture & Design* | 100% Author |
| *Creative Assets* | 100% Author |
| *Feature Decisions* | 100% Author |
| *Code Implementation* | Author-directed, AI-assisted |

AI served as a *productivity tool* — no different from an IDE's autocomplete or referencing Stack Overflow. The author maintained complete creative and technical ownership of the project, with AI accelerating the translation of ideas into code.
